### NewType

Newtype provides type safety and encapsulation through the use of a "tuple struct" with a single field.

The data needs to be accessed either by indexing the tuple (i.e. `self.0`) or destructuring. See *Rust By Example's* [New Type Idiom](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html), repeated below.  

```rust
struct Years(i64);

fn main() {
    let years = Years(42);
    let years_as_primitive_1: i64 = years.0; // Tuple
    let Years(years_as_primitive_2) = years; // Destructuring
}
```

See [Tuple and tuple indexing expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/tuple-expr.html#tuple-and-tuple-indexing-expressions) for tuple indexing.

Derive a bunch of traits on your own types, avoiding boilerplate code with [derive_more](https://crates.io/crates/derive_more)
From *Rust Design Patterns'* [Newtype](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/newtype.html) and also from *Rust By Example's* [New Type Idiom](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html#new-type-idiom)

"If we wanted the new type to have every method the inner type has, implementing the Deref trait (discussed in Chapter 15 in the [Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References with the Deref Trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html#treating-smart-pointers-like-regular-references-with-the-deref-trait) section) on the Wrapper to return the inner type would be a solution." from [Using the Newtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on External Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-to-implement-external-traits-on-external-types)

But [Is it considered a bad practice to implement Deref for newtypes?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45086595/is-it-considered-a-bad-practice-to-implement-deref-for-newtypes) because everything of the underlying type will be visible. Perhaps not what you want. The answer has examples of good, bad and alternative implementation of traits of underlying types.
