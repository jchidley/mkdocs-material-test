He does the weather compensation manually as the automatic one didn't work well for his building (possibly becuase it was old, terraced with a large thermal mass and definetly not a modern house with UFH)
Legionella pasturisation up to 56C from flow temp of 60C once a week. This reduces the DHW COP so don't do it daily! (Might not need it with our house and a temp of 57C)

Need a windy day for leaks and a still day for insulation inspection. Probably need the heating on for a while to stablise internal temperatures so that cold spots visible.
* [Thermal Imaging in HVAC: Theory & Practice w/ Bill Spohn & Eric Kaiser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvzH6H84ENo) use black bin bags (this lecture suggests that it's a thermal shield like a flag in lighting whereas [another lecture](https://youtu.be/RgVk0YCTFRg?si=69CPdJkQQc8F0R2n&t=1606) suggests that it's transpararent - as is the bags used for suits in dry cleaning) and use electrical tape stuck on a relfective surface to see underlying temp. Narrow the range to more clearly see problem areas (put the range close to the desired or avareage room temp).
* [Delta T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgVk0YCTFRg&t=2143s) First thing in the morning, last thing at night, wind, sunlight on surfaces, low humidity.
