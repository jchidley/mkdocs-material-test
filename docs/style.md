# Documentation Style and Improvement Plan

!!! note "LLM Generated"
    This document was generated by Claude (Anthropic) and reviewed by Jack. See [Attribution](#attribution) for details.

This is a living document tracking how I want to improve the Digital Garden over time, while keeping my voice and the organic "garden" nature intact.

## Philosophy

This is a **personal knowledge base**, not formal documentation. Some content is:

- **Structured guides** — where Diátaxis principles genuinely help readers
- **Personal notes** — my thoughts, learning journeys, and explorations
- **Link collections** — curated resources on topics I care about

Not everything needs to be polished. The garden grows organically.

## When Structure Helps

Apply Diátaxis-style structure when a document is:

1. **Instructional** — someone following steps to achieve something
2. **Reference** — looking up facts, commands, or options
3. **Frequently revisited** — I or others return to it regularly

Leave loose when it's:

- A learning journal or exploration
- Early-stage notes that might evolve
- Personal opinions or reflections

## Document Types I Use

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **How-to** | Steps to accomplish a task | Pi Router setup, Arch install |
| **Reference** | Facts, links, commands to look up | Rust-General, link collections |
| **Exploration** | My learning journey, reasoning | How I Learned Rust |
| **Notes** | Raw thoughts, may mature later | Various dated entries |

## Improvement Candidates

Documents that would benefit from structural cleanup (collaborative editing):

### High Value — Instructional Content

These are followed as guides and would benefit from:
- Clear prerequisites
- Expected outputs after commands
- Troubleshooting notes

| Document | Current State | Suggested Improvement |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| `Pi/2020-01-05-Building-A-Raspberry-Pi-Home-Router.md` | Good how-to bones, some narrative mixed in | Separate "why I did this" intro from steps |
| `Linux/2021-06-17-Arch-Linux-Installation.md` | Installation steps | Add expected outputs, common errors |
| `Pi/2022-08-07-Alpine-Image-Build-Raspberry-Pi.md` | Long, detailed | Could use clearer section breaks |
| `2023-11-05-Pi-Pico.md` | Mixed reference/how-to | Clarify what's "look up" vs "follow along" |

### Medium Value — Reference Cleanup

Link collections that could be better organized:

| Document | Suggested Improvement |
|----------|----------------------|
| `2024-05-05-Rust-General.md` | Group links by purpose (learning, libraries, tools) |
| `2025-01-23-Miscellaneous-Links.md` | Already organized; review for stale links |
| `2024-05-05-Rust-Embedded.md` | Separate setup instructions from resource links |

### Leave As-Is — Personal Voice

These are explorations/journals and should stay organic:

- `2024-03-10-How-I-Learned-Rust.md` — learning journey, keep the narrative
- `Other/2023-09-24-Systems-on-Systems.md` — philosophical exploration
- Most dated entries without clear instructional purpose

## Style Guidelines

### For How-to Content

```markdown
## Prerequisites
- Thing you need installed
- Knowledge you should have

## Steps

### 1. Do the first thing

```bash
command here
```

You should see:
```
expected output
```

### 2. Do the next thing
...
```

### For Reference Content

- Use tables for structured data
- Group links by category
- Brief annotations explaining why each link is useful
- Date-stamp sections when adding new content (I already do this)

### For Explorations

- Keep my voice
- Narrative flow is fine
- Links can be inline or collected at end
- No need for rigid structure

## Process

When improving a document:

1. **I decide** which documents to work on
2. **Discuss** proposed changes before editing
3. **Preserve my voice** — rewrite suggestions, don't impose
4. **Iterate** — small improvements over time, not big rewrites

## Review Checklist

Before publishing new how-to content:

- [ ] Prerequisites listed?
- [ ] Commands have expected outputs?
- [ ] Tested recently / version noted?
- [ ] Links working?

For reference content:

- [ ] Organized by purpose, not chronology?
- [ ] Annotations explain why each resource matters?
- [ ] Stale links removed?

## Attribution

This Digital Garden uses LLM assistance for some content. Documents will be marked as follows:

| Frontmatter | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `llm_generated: true` | Document was primarily generated by an LLM, reviewed by Jack |
| `llm_assisted: true` | Document was written by Jack with LLM editing/suggestions |
| *(no tag)* | Written entirely by Jack |

All LLM-assisted content is reviewed before publishing. The goal is transparency, not disclaiming responsibility — I stand behind everything published here.
