# Testing with F\#

**TL;DR** I now use [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) and [FsCheck](https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/) which I run through Visual Studio's Test Explorer.  Setting-up and using this has been surprisingly straight-forward and a *massive* leap forward for my programming.

## Introduction

I have been writing tests for a long time but these have been ad-hoc in-line additions to my programs.  Like adding `printfn "This is the current value of variable f"` statements.  This  has hurt the readability and thus maintainability of my programs.  There was no clear distinction between tests and working code.  

I knew that I needed something more as I firmly believe in testing.  From my research a 'proper' system seemed difficult.

I have been attracted to property testing since reading [Scott Wlaschin's excellent blog](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing/) and watching [Kit Eason's illuminating web cast](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/9726-a-gazillion-ways-to-test-with-f-sharp).  

## Picking FsCheck and XUnit

Earlier this week, I took the plunge and invested time into learning [FsCheck](https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/) and, by extension, [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) and [nUnit](http://nunit.org/). 

[NCrunch](http://www.ncrunch.net/) is really attractive but Â£125.10 is a lot for a hobbyist like me but must be peanuts for a professional so I haven't decided.  I think I need to do more testing of testing before I can decide if the time saved will be worth it.

FsCheck, which is based on Haskell's [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck), is attractive to me as thinking up properties and testing with random data strikes me as a really good way to fix bugs and think deeply about the production code, leading to refactoring.  However, there are times when I just want to test a specific known cases and for that a unit testing framework is necessary.  

I looked at NUnit and xUnit and both seem excellent.  Either would do as they're both well supported, work in similar ways and are extensively used.  I chose xUnit because if the slightly stronger support for FsCheck, its cleaner design and implementation and the fact it's newer.

xUnit has a console runner - which I am sure I will use - but I like IDEs so I have gone for the Visual Studio integration.

## Learning How to Test Properly
I just followed the Kit's and Scott's guidance, the specific instructions on the products' web sites and spent some time trying it out.  There were lot of extra web sites that I found useful: see the links below.  

In all I spent several days on it.  Well worth the time as now I have a more effective testing system and my tests are clearly marked in the source code.
