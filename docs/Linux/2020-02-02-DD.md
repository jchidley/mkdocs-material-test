# DD for Backup and Restore
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

## FixMe

Try everything out

Have done this for Windows 10 and Raspberry pi.

Need to name things better

## Introduction

Backup and restore using DD is relatively straightforward but DD is such a low level and powerful command it is extremely easy to erase your disks.

In any case, the best method seems to be:

1. Shrink your disks, for smaller backups and to fit on the smallest disks
1. Zero out all of the unused disk space, to allow for compression of the remaining space
1. Save the disk layout, partition table etc
1. Compress the backup as you make it

## Zero Unused/Deleted Data

### Windows

use fsutil.exe to clear out free space.

```cmd
fsutil volume diskfree f:
fsutil file createnew F:\clear 249899469856
fsutil file setvaliddata F:\clear 249899469856
fsutil file setzerodata offset=0 length=249899469856 F:\clear
del f:\clear
```

The key is to specify a directory on the volume that you want to wipe the used data from.  Can be any directory (., .., c:\Users) as the directory is just used to identify the drive.

cipher does a secure wipe, probably not necessary and might leave random numbers behind.

```cmd
cipher /W:c:\
```

[SDelete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete) is a free download from Microsoft.  It is part of sysutils.

```cmd
sdelete -z c:\
```

### Linux

`zerofree`

[Other methods of doing this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/251804)

## Archive and Compress Linux

`gzip` is available almost everywhere and is [fast](https://tukaani.org/lzma/benchmarks.html). `bzip2` and `xz` are also available everywhere and are [slow with high compression](https://www.rootusers.com/gzip-vs-bzip2-vs-xz-performance-comparison/). 7zip (`7z`) gets the [highest overall compression](https://superuser.com/a/205984).

## Backup Disks

Backup drive uses NTFS, so need a driver for it.

`pacman -S ntfs-3g`
Create a directory for the specific machine and then a folder with the time since unix epoch:

`mkdir $(date +%s)`

Using the hosted operated system, shrink the partitions (as they will only fit on the same size or larger ones) and zero free space (to aid compression).

fdisk /dev/sda, option O for partition table

work out correct input block size by testing using [Tuning dd block size](http://blog.tdg5.com/tuning-dd-block-size/)
[dd_obs_test.sh](https://github.com/tdg5/blog/blob/master/_includes/scripts/dd_obs_test.sh)
[dd_ibs_test.sh](https://github.com/tdg5/blog/blob/master/_includes/scripts/dd_ibs_test.sh)

`./dd_ibs_test.sh ~/sde2/delete_me > ~/sde2/dd_ibs_results.usb3`

backup partition tables of GPT disks using [Rod Smith's GPT fdisk utility](http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/download.html)

`sudo sgdisk -b=sda.sgdisk.bak /dev/sda`
 
backup individual partitions.  Gzip is used because it is fast.

`dd if=/dev/sda2 bs=1M conv=noerror,sync status=progress | gzip -c >./sda2.img.gz`

## Restore Disks

* Using the `sda.sgdisk.bak` file recreate the partitions using `fdisk` or similar
* Work out the correct block size for input and output
`./dd_ibs_test.sh ~/sde2/delete_me > ~/sde2/dd_ibs_results.usb3 # delete_me needs to be on the file system under test`
* `dd if=./sde1.img of=/dev/sde1 bs=1M conv=noerror,sync status=progress`
* `gzip -d ./sde2.img.gz | dd of=/dev/sde2 bs=1M conv=noerror,sync status=progress`
