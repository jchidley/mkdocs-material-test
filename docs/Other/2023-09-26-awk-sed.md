# Awk Sed
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

## Introduction

Don't forget to use both `man` and `info` commands to learn more about the vairous utitlies that `sed` and `awk` depend upon, like `sort`, `xargs` and `find` for example.

## sed

* [Sed - grymoire - An Introduction and Tutorial by Bruce Barnett](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html)

## Here documents

[Here Documents](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# generate-script.sh
# Based on an idea by Albert Reiner.

OUTFILE=generated.sh         # Name of the file to generate.

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 'Here document containing the body of the generated script.
(
cat <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "This is a generated shell script."
#  Note that since we are inside a subshell,
#+ we can't access variables in the "outside" script.

echo "Generated file will be named: $OUTFILE"
#  Above line will not work as normally expected
#+ because parameter expansion has been disabled.
#  Instead, the result is literal output.

a=7
b=3

let "c = $a * $b"
echo "c = $c"

exit 0
EOF
) > $OUTFILE
# -----------------------------------------------------------

#  Quoting the 'limit string' prevents variable expansion
#+ within the body of the above 'here document.'
#  This permits outputting literal strings in the output file.

if [ -f "$OUTFILE" ]
then
  chmod 755 $OUTFILE
  # Make the generated file executable.
else
  echo "Problem in creating file: \"$OUTFILE\""
fi

#  This method also works for generating
#+ C programs, Perl programs, Python programs, Makefiles,
#+ and the like.

exit 0
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# here-function.sh

GetPersonalData ()
{
  read firstname
  read lastname
  read address
  read city 
  read state 
  read zipcode
} # This certainly appears to be an interactive function, but . . .

# Supply input to the above function.
GetPersonalData <<RECORD001
Bozo
Bozeman
2726 Nondescript Dr.
Bozeman
MT
21226
RECORD001

echo
echo "$firstname $lastname"
echo "$address"
echo "$city, $state $zipcode"
echo

exit 0
```

## awk 

```bash
awk -f awkscriptfile

cat << "EOF" > executableawk
#!/bin/awk -f
BEGIN {
    lines=0;
    total=0;
}
{
# increase the number of files
    lines++;
# increase the total size, which is field #1
    total+=$1;
}
END {
    print lines " lines read";
    print "total is ", total;
    if (lines > 0 ) {
	print "average is ", total/lines;
    } else {
	print "average is 0";
    }
}
EOF
chmod +x executableawk
wc -c * | ./executableawk

# ${variable:-defaultvalue}, variable=value
cat << "EOF" > bashawk.sh
#!/bin/sh
awk '{print $c}' c="${1:-1}"
# awk '{print $'"${1:-1}"'}'
# or 
# column="${1:-1}"
# awk '{print $'"$column"'}'
EOF
chmod +x bashawk.sh
ls -l | ./bashawk.sh 9 # filename printed
```

* [awk - grymoire - An Introduction and Tutorial by Bruce Barnett](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html) it's worth noting that grymoire's notes are for very old versions of Unix and Linux. For the example of `count_new_users` the sort that I used was `sort -k 1nr,2 -k 3d,4` and not the, by today's standards, cryptic original `sort +0nr -2 +2d`
