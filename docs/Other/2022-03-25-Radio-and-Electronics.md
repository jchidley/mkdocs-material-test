## Simulation Software

Limits of SPICE (and other simulation). Parastics need to be moddeled. Models of various components are only approximations owing to the manufacturers intellectual property concerns and, probably, desire to reduce simulation complexity.

## QSPICE

finding models

Micro-Cap 12 from Spectrum software has a lot of models included.

It's `mc12cd.zip_Spectrum_Software_Spice_Simulator_12.2.0.5.zip` on my OneDrive.

```bash
# assumes model begins with '.model' and continues with '\n+'
# search for "2n222" in "filename"
awk 'BEGIN{IGNORECASE=1} /\.model\s+*2n222/{f=1; print; next} /^\s*[^+]/{f=0} f' filename 
# I think f is being used to do the default action (print) or nothing
# for a one liner add 
find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 # before awk and drop the "filename", use -r for recursive
```

ctrl-enter to add lines to an exisiting text(spice directive). `qsch` are 8-bit encoded [Windows-1252 or CP-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252), these can be read in `nvim` or `notepad`. The command reference is in the help informaiton under simulator.
"The analog circuit simulation was originally based on a download of Berkeley SPICE from ptolemy.berkeley.edu. Specifically the version of 3F5 available in early 2020", [documentaiton appears to be at](http://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcBook/SPICE/) and there's [All about Circuits documentation too](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/reference/chpt-7/fundamentals-spice-programming/). Apparently it's normal for it to be cryptic and undocumented. I know that some syntax has been lifted from elsewhere.

The first few chars in the file, according to Mike Engelhardt, "I put those charactors there so certain e-mail servers don’t convert the contents of the file. QSPICE symbols and schematics look like ASCII, and can be edited in notepad or any other eight-bit clean otherwise “ASCII” editor. But they are not ASCII. So I give the files the same majic number as JPEG. E-mail servers don’t touch the contents of JPEG."

Troubleshooting Analog Circuits by Bob Pease

Wires

1) Inductive effects can be ignored if the resistance of the wire is substantial enough – this is the case for long aluminum wires with a small cross section, for example, or if the rise and fall times of the applied signals are slow.
2) When wires are short, the cross section of the wire is large (the interconnect has a low resistivity), a capacitance-only model can be used.  
3) When the separation between neighboring wires is large, or when the wires run together for a short distance, interwire capacitance can be ignored, and all parasitic capacitance can be modeled as capacitance to ground.
