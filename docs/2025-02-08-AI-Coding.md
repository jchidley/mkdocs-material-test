## How LLMs Work

The best video introduction, by an AI industry insider: [Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://youtu.be/7xTGNNLPyMI?si=G7DD2K2sPorAV9le) (Andrej Karpathy). His companion links:

## Finding LLM-Shaped Problems (The Jagged Frontier)

The real skill isn't prompt crafting — it's recognising which problems are LLM-shaped. LLMs are shockingly good at some things and shockingly bad at others, and the boundary is jagged and non-intuitive.

- [Ethan Mollick — One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) — free, ongoing. Every post explores what is/isn't LLM-shaped. See also [Pragmatic AI Blogs](2026-01-20-Pragmatic-AI-Programming-Blogs.md).
- [Simon Willison — 2025: The Year in LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/) — comprehensive annual review of what changed, what works, what doesn't.
- [Simon Willison — LLM Predictions for 2026](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/)
- [Simon Willison — How StrongDM's AI team build serious software without even looking at the code](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/) — non-interactive "software factory" where specs drive agents. Feb 2026.
- [LLMs as a Lossy Encyclopedia](https://adam.holter.com/llms-as-a-lossy-encyclopedia-why-specific-technical-tasks-fail-and-how-to-fix-it/) — great mental model: LLMs shine at processing/understanding/adapting information, not precise retrieval.
- [AI tools for software engineers, but without the hype — Simon Willison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRuLgar5XZw)

## Context Engineering (Beyond Prompt Engineering)

The shift from crafting clever prompts to engineering the input environment — giving the model everything it needs to succeed. This is what pi skills do. See [Addy Osmani's Elevate](https://addyo.substack.com/) for the best ongoing coverage.

## Understanding Agent Architecture

Agents are simpler than the hype suggests: it's a loop with inputs and outputs from an environment where it can call tools to augment itself. You don't need to build agents from scratch — just understand the loop well enough to use agent tools effectively and not get suckered by hype.

- [Anthropic — Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) — canonical reference. Progression from prompt chaining → routing → tool use → autonomous loop. Also: [walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZzyPscbtI8), [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx5OapbK-8A).
- [AI Agents from First Principles](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/ai-agents) (Cameron R. Wolfe) — builds from basic LLM concepts to agents. Always free. Excellent.
- [How AI Agents Really Work: Beyond the Hype, Inside the Architecture](https://medium.com/@gianluca.mondillo/how-ai-agents-really-work-beyond-the-hype-inside-the-architecture-aa6c892a5c2a) — what's actually happening under the hood.
- [Building Robust Agentic AI: Why Simplicity and Observability Matter More Than Cleverness](https://tonywood.co/blog/building-robust-agentic-ai-why-simplicity-and-observability-matter-more-than-cleverness) — simple loops with good feedback beat clever architectures.
- [OpenClaw Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAbrRTu5xcw) (CJ Avilla) — demystifies why AI agents feel "alive". It's inputs, queues, and a loop.
- [Chess tools built with Claude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSj69yLmwMg) — 61-year-old non-programmer builds real tools through conversational coding.
