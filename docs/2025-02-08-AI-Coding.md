Apparently, it's best to convert sites to markdown. As of early 2025 [Crawl4AI: Open-Source LLM-Friendly Web Crawler & Scraper](https://crawl4ai.com/mkdocs/) seems to be the most used tool.

[Web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) "Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.[1] Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis."

[Introduction to robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro)

"A `robots.txt` file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page."

[Build and submit a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap) `sitemap.xml` "The XML sitemap format is the most versatile of the supported formats. Using the Google supported sitemap extensions, you can also provide additional information about your images, video, and news content, as well as the localized versions of your pages."

[What are Sitemaps](https://www.sitemaps.org/)
"What are Sitemaps?
Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for crawling. In its simplest form, a Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs for a site along with additional metadata about each URL (when it was last updated, how often it usually changes, and how important it is, relative to other URLs in the site) so that search engines can more intelligently crawl the site.

Web crawlers usually discover pages from links within the site and from other sites. Sitemaps supplement this data to allow crawlers that support Sitemaps to pick up all URLs in the Sitemap and learn about those URLs using the associated metadata. Using the Sitemap protocol does not guarantee that web pages are included in search engines, but provides hints for web crawlers to do a better job of crawling your site."

Based on the above, I'll be investing my "AI" programming effort into:

1. Python
1. JavaScript (including `css` and `html`), see [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp). Probably [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) — W3Schools' HTML tutorial page offering free lessons to learn HTML markup language for creating websites, with interactive examples, exercises, quiz...
1. shell (I assume that this is mostly `bash`)
1. rust - because I like it
1. Lisp ([Steel](https://github.com/mattwparas/steel)) because there's loads of examples of people writing their own versions of these and my editor will use it. — Steel is an embeddable Scheme interpreter written in Rust, designed to be extensible and usable as a scripting language within Rust applications.

[Advice on prompting](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#advice-on-prompting)
"These models perform best with straightforward prompts. Some prompt engineering techniques, like instructing the model to "think step by step," may not enhance performance (and can sometimes hinder it). Here are some best practices:

- Developer messages are the new system messages: Starting with o1-2024-12-17, reasoning models support developer messages rather than system messages, to align with the chain of command behavior described in the model spec.
- Keep prompts simple and direct: The models excel at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions.
- Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning" is unnecessary.
- Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like markdown, XML tags, and section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.
- Try zero shot first, then few shot if needed: Reasoning models often don't need few-shot examples to produce good results, so try to write prompts without examples first. If you have more complex requirements for your desired output, it may help to include a few examples of inputs and desired outputs in your prompt. Just ensure that the examples align very closely with your prompt instructions, as discrepancies between the two may produce poor results.
- Provide specific guidelines: If there are ways you explicitly want to constrain the model's response (like "propose a solution with a budget under $500"), explicitly outline those constraints in the prompt.
- Be very specific about your end goal: In your instructions, try to give very specific parameters for a successful response, and encourage the model to keep reasoning and iterating until it matches your success criteria.
- Markdown formatting: Starting with o1-2024-12-17, reasoning models in the API will avoid generating responses with markdown formatting. To signal to the model when you do want markdown formatting in the response, include the string Formatting re-enabled on the first line of your developer message."

[How to use ChatGPT to write code: What it does well and what it doesn't](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code-what-it-does-well-and-what-it-doesnt/)

"
* ChatGPT can produce both useful and unusable code. For best results, provide clear and detailed prompts.
* ChatGPT excels in assisting with specific coding tasks or routines, rather than building complete applications from scratch.
* Use ChatGPT to find and choose the right coding libraries for specific purposes, and engage in an interactive discussion to narrow down options.
* Be cautious about the ownership of AI-generated code and always verify the code's reliability. Don't blindly trust the generated output.
* Treat interactions with ChatGPT as a conversation. Refine your questions based on the AI's responses to get closer to the desired output.
