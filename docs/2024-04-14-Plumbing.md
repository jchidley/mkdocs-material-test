Heat Loss and Air Change Rates (Ventialation)

[Air change rate calculation methods](https://docs.openenergymonitor.org/heatpumps/air_change_rate_calculations.html)

[Measuring air change rates with CO2 sensors for heat pump heat loss calculation](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/measuring-air-change-rates-with-co2-sensors-for-heat-pump-heat-loss-calculation/25817/35)

"In the interim for those in less windy parts of the UK perhaps just using a figure such as 0.5-0.7 ACH and accepting that in rare events some form of hybrid heat may be needed"

"very few days that get anywhere near 23K DT between the living room temp and outside"

"I have a 30 year old prefab house with a moisture barrier, so my ACH when keeping windows closed is around 0.1 or less (CO2 half life in my living room is 8 hours). I’m using CO2 sensors + notifications from Home Assistant to open the windows when air quality gets bad. This way I’m also not blowing too much heat out the window. It will be interesting looking at wind speed and correlating it."

"For the heat loss surveys in Germany they (have to) assume 0.5 ACH if no measurements are available. That’s also the value they have to target for designing ventilation systems for new houses. I already found 0.5 quite high since in the survey that accounts for around 30% of my heat loss. Seeing rates of 2 or higher seems crazy and it’s no wonder that this might lead to oversized heat pumps."

"Electricity Used per Day = 36.4 + 1.25*(wind speed) - 3.2*(air temperature). This model has an r2 of 90% so nearly all variability in electrical energy used is accounted for."

" I changed to using “effective temp 1” to compensate for the windy weather."

### Flow and Pressure

I am designing my central heating (pipes, valves, emitters, cylinders) to a pressure drop budget that is given by the pump(s) in the heat source, and the flow rate of that source.
