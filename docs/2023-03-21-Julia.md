## Quick Start

[The Fast Track to julia or A quick and dirty overview of julia](https://cheatsheet.juliadocs.org/)
On linux install [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) and add a [shebang to Julia script](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/faq/#How-do-I-pass-options-to-julia-using-#!/usr/bin/env?) and then `chmod +x` it.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
cat <<'EOF' >> myjuliaexec
#!/bin/bash
#=
exec julia --color=yes --startup-file=no -e 'include(popfirst!(ARGS))' \
    "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" "$@"
=#

@show ARGS  # put any Julia code here
EOF
chmod +x myjuliaexec
./myjuliaexec
```

*startup*

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.julia/config
cat << 'EOF' >> ~/.julia/config/startup.jl
prrintln("Hi from ~/.julia/config/startup.jl")
EOF
```

REPL history: `~/.julia/logs/repl_history.jl`

#
Everything in julia is based on packages. Even the language server (at least in neovim) will not work without being run from a package.

In vim, change directory to the current file (lcd changes it locally only - for the current window)

```vim
:cd %:p:h
```

```text
BenchmarkTools
CairoMakie
Distributions
PkgTemplates
PythonCall
Revise
TerminalPager
UnicodePlots
```

## Workflow

* [Workflow for Testing Packages](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/#Workflow-for-Testing-Packages)

Entering this command (or an equivalent) will potentially save a lot of hassle `julia -e 'import Pkg; println(Pkg.devdir())' | cd`

```julia
import Pkg
cd(Pkg.devdir()) # the standard development directory
Pkg.generate("Tmp")
cd("Tmp")
```

```julia
mkdir("test")
Pkg.activate("test")
Pkg.add("Test")
Pkg.activate(".")
```

First write failing tests. There's a **lot** of worrisome output that can be safely ignored.

```julia
write("test/runtests.jl",
"""
using Tmp
using Test

@testset "Tmp tests" begin

	@testset "Math tests" begin
        @test 2 == simple_add(1, 1)
        @test_throws MethodError simple_add(1, "A")
    end

end
""");
Pkg.test()
```

Expected output:
```text
...
Test Summary: | Fail  Error  Total  Time
Tmp tests     |    1      1      2  0.9s
  Math tests  |    1      1      2  0.9s
...
```

Now write a function to pass the tests:

```julia
write("src/Tmp.jl",
"""
module Tmp

export simple_add

function simple_add(a, b)
    a + b
end

end # module Tmp
""");
Pkg.test()
```

Expected output:
```text
...
Test Summary: | Pass  Total  Time
Tmp tests     |    2      2  0.0s
     Testing Tmp tests passed
```

Now is a good time to [add documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/)

Interactive testing:

```julia
julia> using Tmp
julia> simple_add(1, 2)
3
```

```julia
julia

? # help
apropos("thing") # find something helpful
# <TAB><TAB> expand available options, to say a function
; # open shell
tldr cpio # extremely helpful tool to show the basic examples of a command (cpio in this case)
methods(+) # list methods for the function (+ in this case)
using TerminalPager
methodswith(IO) |> pager
# \alp<TAB><TAB> autocomplete
clipboard("thing") # send "thing" to the system clipboard
@time sin(1)
using BenchmarkTools
@benchmark sin(1)
@btime sin(1)
@code_lowered(sin(1)) # detailed information on how the code is processed at a low level
@code_llvm(sin(1))
@code_native(sin(1))
@code_warntype(sin(2)) # inspect warnings, like type conversions (avoid any types)
using Latexify
Latexify.set_default(; starred=true)
m = [2//3 "e^(-c*t)" 1+3im; :(x/(x+k_1)) "gamma(n)" :(log10(x))]
latexify(m)
# really cool LaTeX output
and # last output, repl only
```

To help make things generic, then can use:

```julia
zero(eltype(thing)) # the zero type of thing (if thing is integer, then it'll be 1)
one(4.0) # 1.0
# could be used as the first part of a function, to make sure that types are correct, say the running total in a sum function.
```

* [PyCall does not use virtualenv](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl/issues/706#issuecomment-610316716)
* [How can I import a module dynamically given the full path?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/129374/3617057)

For a whole stack of reasons, it's best to use Julia's inbuilt Miniconda environment.The following code will need to be added to the top of any script, otherwise PyCall will use Julia's conda but the rest of the script will be using whatever the system's python is.

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("PyCall")
import Conda
ENV["PYCALL_JL_RUNTIME_PYTHON"] = Conda.ROOTENV
ENV["PYTHON"] = Conda.ROOTENV
```
add the required packages...

```julia
Conda.add("openpyxl")
# etc
```

The extra wrinkle is that Julia's Conda doesn't know or understand any of your path so you'll have to explicitly tell it what path is the base one:

```python
import sys

sys.path.append("/Users/jchidley/git/personal_finance_py_rust/my_project")
```

Then you can call your modules in Julia like so:

```julia
@pyinclude("monte_carlo_finance.py")
```

And Julia's Conda will report back missing imports, etc

[Running Julia .jl files](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22241095/3617057)

After you have written a new julia script, it can be run with `julia path/to/script-name.jl` or

```julia
include("path/to/script-name.jl")
```

# loading libraries, initialising variables, etc
```

```julia

* [Generic smallcheck - single file](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/smallcheck/LazySmallCheckGeneric.hs)
"N.B., you should (almost) always go with lazy smallcheck rather than the original smallcheck. Lazy Smallcheck is far more efficient at exhaustively exploring the value space, so it can test much larger values before the exhaustive search becomes infeasible.                     0
The way it works is that it uses partially defined values; for example, if the property holds for (x:undefined) then we know it must hold for all lists beginning with x, regardless of what the rest of the list looks like. So all those infinitely many inputs can be marked off as having been checked. Thus, the only reason not to use lazy smallcheck is if your properties are totally strict in their inputs, and thus can't benefit from this sort of thing."
