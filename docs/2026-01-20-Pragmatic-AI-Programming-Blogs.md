# Pragmatic AI & Programming Blogs

A curated list of bloggers who write about AI and programming with a pragmatic, no-hype approach. They favour simple, obvious solutions and have each shipped major well-regarded projects.

Inspired by: [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), [Mario Zechner](https://mariozechner.at/), [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/)

### Why They Fit

- **Simon Willison**: Prolific blogger, builds in public. Django co-creator, now focused on practical AI tooling (Datasette, llm CLI).
- **Mario Zechner**: libGDX creator. Deep technical posts on compression, graphics, and systems programming.
- **Armin Ronacher**: Flask, Jinja2, Click, Rye creator. Writes thoughtfully about language design and developer experience.
- **Sebastian Raschka**: Deep technical explainers with code. No hype, just "here's how it actually works."
- **Andrej Karpathy**: Legendary for making complex concepts accessible. Practical, hands-on.
- **Jeremy Howard**: "Making neural nets uncool again" - pragmatism over complexity.
- **Hamel Husain**: Writes posts like "Fuck You, Show Me The Prompt" - extremely practical, no BS.
- **Julia Evans**: Master of explaining hard things simply. Zines are delightful. Not AI-focused but similar pragmatic style.
- **Peter Steinberger**: iOS veteran turned AI-native developer. Writes candidly about AI-assisted workflows ("Just Talk To It", "Shipping at Inference-Speed"). Ships constantly.
- **Geoffrey Huntley**: Builds commercial AI coding agents. Writes definitive guides on context engineering, MCP servers, secure code generation. No-BS practitioner perspective.
- **Amos Wenger**: Long-form, exploratory Rust content. "An excuse to teach Rust" through deep dives into how things actually work. Also does video.

## Tier 2: Excellent, Slightly More Specialized

| Person | Blog | Focus | Last Updated |
|--------|------|-------|--------------|
| **Chip Huyen** | [huyenchip.com](https://huyenchip.com/blog/) | ML systems design, MLOps | Active |
| **Eugene Yan** | [eugeneyan.com](https://eugeneyan.com/) | RecSys, LLM patterns, applied ML | Nov 2025 |
| **Vicki Boykis** | [vickiboykis.com](https://vickiboykis.com/) | ML infra, embeddings, production ML | Dec 2025 |

| **Jay Alammar** | [jalammar.github.io](https://jalammar.github.io/) | Visual ML explanations | Active |

### Why They Fit

- **Chip Huyen**: Author of "Designing ML Systems". Production-focused.
- **Eugene Yan**: Amazon Principal Scientist. "Patterns for LLM-based Systems" is essential reading.
- **Vicki Boykis**: Now at Mozilla.ai. Writes about the boring-but-critical stuff.
- **Lilian Weng**: VP Research at OpenAI. Comprehensive, well-cited deep dives.
- **Jay Alammar**: "The Illustrated Transformer" - referenced in MIT/Cornell courses.

## Tier 3: Worth Following

| Person | Blog | Focus | Last Updated |
|--------|------|-------|--------------|
| **Arvind Narayanan & Sayash Kapoor** | [aisnakeoil.com](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/) | AI hype skepticism | May 2025 |
| **swyx (Shawn Wang)** | [swyx.io](https://www.swyx.io/) / [Latent Space](https://www.latent.space/) | AI Engineer movement | Active |
| **Mitchell Hashimoto** | [mitchellh.com](https://mitchellh.com/) | Pragmatic engineering | Aug 2025 |
| **Rachel Thomas** | [rachel.fast.ai](https://rachel.fast.ai/) | AI ethics | Active |

## Legendary: Pure Builder

| Person | Site | Major Projects | Last Updated |
|--------|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Fabrice Bellard** | [bellard.org](https://bellard.org/) | QEMU, FFmpeg, TinyCC, QuickJS, JSLinux, TinyEMU, TSAC, ts_zip | Jan 2026 |

Fabrice Bellard is in a category of his own. Not a blogger—his site is a sparse list of projects. But every project is foundational infrastructure that millions depend on. Recent work includes **ts_zip** and **TSAC** (using LLMs for compression), **Micro QuickJS** (JS for microcontrollers), and **TextSynth** (LLM inference server). The defining trait: solving impossibly hard problems with minimal code, often solo.

## Key Characteristics They Share

- Ship real projects (not just commentary)
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Write to teach, not to impress
- Critical of hype but not dismissive
- Strong "show me the code" energy
