# Pragmatic AI & Programming Blogs

A curated list of bloggers who write about AI and programming with a pragmatic, no-hype approach. They favour simple, obvious solutions and have each shipped major well-regarded projects.

## Tier 3: Worth Following

| Person | Blog | Focus | Last Updated |

## Builders First, Writers Second

These people are known primarily for the software they've built. Their writing exists but isn't regular blogging—it's documentation, courses, or occasional essays about their work.

| Person | Site | Social | Major Projects |
|--------|------|--------|----------------|
| **Fabrice Bellard** | [bellard.org](https://bellard.org/) | — | QEMU, FFmpeg, TinyCC, QuickJS, JSLinux, TSAC, ts_zip |
| **Jeremy Howard** | [jeremy.fast.ai](https://jeremy.fast.ai/) / [Answer.AI](https://www.answer.ai/) | [@jeremyphoward](https://x.com/jeremyphoward) | fast.ai, fastai library (25k ⭐), ULMFiT, nbdev |

- **Fabrice Bellard**: Solves impossibly hard problems with minimal code, often solo. Every project is foundational infrastructure. Recent: ts_zip and TSAC (LLM-based compression), TextSynth (LLM inference).
- **Jeremy Howard**: "Making neural nets uncool again." Created ULMFiT (foundation for modern LLMs), fastai, nbdev. Teaches via courses (course.fast.ai) rather than blog posts. Now running Answer.AI.

## Key Characteristics They Share

- Ship real projects (not just commentary)
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Write to teach, not to impress
- Critical of hype but not dismissive
- Strong "show me the code" energy
