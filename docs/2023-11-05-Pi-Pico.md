## Install Raspberry Pi Pico

https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/pico-development-using-wsl
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->

after you've made the various standard Raspberry Pi examples, I suggest that you copy over the hello_world/usb example.

Now it's time to install the necessary software for the usb exmple to test out serial communication. I suggest that you [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to test out the connection on the Windows side.

On Windows run the "Device Manager" and expand the Ports (COM & LPT) section. Note the COM port number for the Pico; on my system it's labelled "USB Serial Device (COM7)".

Open PuTTY, select the Serial connection type and enter the COM7 (see above) in the Serial line box. Set the Speed to 115200 and click on the Open button. A window should open that repetively prints "Hello, World!".

Now it's time to deal with the WSL side of things.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->

```cmd
winget install usbipd
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->
https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/wiki/WSL-support
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->

```ubuntu
sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1` 20
```

```cmd
usbipd wsl list
# look for Picoprobe entry, like this:
# 1-2    2e8a:0004  USB Serial Device (COM5), Picoprobe
# you might not need the "--distribution ubuntu" part if you only have one WSL distribution installed
usbipd wsl attach --busid 1-2 --distribution ubuntu
```

### openocd

```ubuntu
$ sudo apt install automake autoconf build-essential texinfo libtool libftdi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt install pkg-config # missing on my WSL ubuntu
$ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd.git --branch rp2040-v0.12.0 --depth=1 --no-single-branch
cd openocd
./bootstrap
./configure
make -j8
sudo make install
```

## Build

`cmake -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w ..` for Pico W

## Additional Packages

In [micropython-lib](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib) there are bunch of sub directories that can be isntalled. First the Pico has to be connected to the internet.

```python
# connect to device on mpremote
# connect to internet
import mip
mip.install("aiorepl") # for example
```

if the Micropython device isn't network connected then the host machine can be used instead.

```python
import mip
mpremote mip install pkgname
```
